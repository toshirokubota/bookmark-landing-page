## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

This was my first attemp to use Tailwind for styling. It was difficult to get introduced into and adjusted to the framework. In particular, at first it was tedious to populate the html elements with all sort of utility classes. I think that I need to strike a better balance between the convenience of pre-defined classes Tailwind provides and the succinctness with custom classes. 

### Continued development

I continue working on the advanced CSS learning path.

### Useful resources

- [the official Tailwind CSS site](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This was needed frequently to find proper Tailwind utility classes and explanation of its classes.
